This is an old Strategy I wrote quite some time ago for an Interview. The idea is to have offsetting positions on multiple perps to farm funding rates. Obvously one of the exchanges it uses doesn't exist any more but it should hold up if you use any combination of exchanges. Feel free to use as you please. The code should be tidied.
